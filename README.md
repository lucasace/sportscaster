## About the Project

Sportscaster is a reliable sports API which scrapes data from the most reliable sources 
in the internet and organizes them in a neat and easy to use JSON format.

Reasons why I built this
* There aren't a lot of free sports APIs on the internet
* Scraping data is ridiculously boring and tiresome (Let me do that task for you)

Ofcourse, the API is not complete and I will continue to make it better so 
if you have any issues or want something that is not in the API yet, feel free to raise a issue

A list of sites I scraped for this API are listed in acknowledgements

## Getting Started

The API is very simple to use , all you have to do is know what you want to search for!

A sample is given below

```bash
curl bla bla bla
```

returns the following output

```
allalala
```

## Currently Supported Sports

* Cricket (in-development)
